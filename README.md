# 🧪 Excavate: ML-Based Material Property Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify and predict the insulating properties of materials based on a dataset derived from material science experiments.

## 📌 Project Summary

- 🚀 **Goal**: Predict whether a material is an insulator based on its features and estimate its band gap using regression.
- 🧠 **Models Used**:
  - **Classification**: Random Forest Classifier
  - **Regression**: Random Forest Regressor (for predicting PBE band gap)
- 🧼 **Preprocessing**:
  - Label encoding for categorical features
  - Median imputation for missing values
  - Standardization using `StandardScaler`

## 🧠 Key Concepts

* **Band Gap Classification**: Materials with a band gap ≥ 0.5 eV are classified as **insulators**, otherwise **conductors**.
* **Label Encoding**: Converts categorical text data into numeric codes.
* **Feature Scaling**: Standardization to ensure better ML model performance.

---

## 📈 Sample Results

* **Classifier Accuracy**: \~90%+ using `RandomForestClassifier`
* **Regressor Performance**: Tested on filtered insulators, evaluates PBE band gap prediction.
